## FAQ

#### 1. Will this be updated in the future?
    I do plan to revisit this sometime in the future, it's a goofy little project, 
    but I would like to at some point add mouse support, and add actual images to 
    the cards instead of them being flat text.

#### 2. My game is stuck, I picked up a card and now it wont let me drop it anywhere.
    Yeah, that happens, there are enough bugs here to make a Florida swap Jealous.


## Disclaimer
Be warned, This is kind of a buggy mess, it was created in less than a month for a college class, and I had never touched the ADA language before this. Things are broken, things will break, and there is a lot thats ridiculously inefficient, but it's pretty cool to have made something like this from scratch.
